## Test Suites

### 1. Service Health Checks

**File:** `test_learning_flow.py::test_all_services_healthy`

Verifies all microservices are running and responding to health checks.

**Expected Result:** ✅ All services return 200 status

**Troubleshooting:**
- If fails: Check `./scripts/start-all-services.sh` ran successfully
- Check logs: `tail -f logs/*.log`

---

### 2. Authentication Tests

**Tests:**
- `test_user_registration` - Register new user
- `test_user_login` - Login with credentials
- `test_user_login` (from fixture) - Token-based auth

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ User created in database
- ✅ LearnerProfile initialized with defaults
- ✅ JWT token issued
- ✅ Token valid for API requests

**Common Issues:**
- Email already exists → Use unique timestamp in email
- Password too weak → Minimum 8 chars, includes number/symbol
- Database connection lost → Restart PostgreSQL

---

### 3. Learning Session Tests

**Tests:**
- `test_start_learning_session` - Initialize session
- `test_answer_card_good_rating` - Answer with "good"
- `test_complete_full_session` - Complete 10 cards

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Session ID generated
- ✅ Cards loaded from Scheduler (FSRS)
- ✅ First card displayed
- ✅ XP earned on each answer
- ✅ Progress tracked
- ✅ All data persists in database

**Performance Targets:**
- Session start: < 500ms
- Card load: < 200ms
- Answer processing: < 300ms

**Common Issues:**
- No cards available → Run seed script
- Cards not from Scheduler → Check Scheduler service running
- Timeout → Increase `TIMEOUT` in test config

---

### 4. FSRS Scheduling Tests

**Test:** `test_fsrs_scheduling_intervals`

Verifies FSRS algorithm calculates correct review intervals.

**Expected Intervals:**
| Rating | Expected Interval |
|--------|------------------|
| Again (1) | Minutes to hours |
| Hard (2) | Hours to 1 day |
| Good (3) | 1-5 days |
| Easy (4) | 3-15 days |

**Note:** Exact intervals depend on current stability/difficulty parameters.

**Common Issues:**
- Intervals too short → Check FSRS parameters initialized
- Intervals too long → Check card difficulty setting
- Endpoint not found → Scheduler service not implementing `/review`

---

### 5. ZPD Adaptation Tests

**Tests:**
- `test_zpd_frustration_zone` - Detect low performance
- `test_zpd_comfort_zone` - Detect high performance

**Expected ZPD Zones:**
| Success Rate | ZPD Zone | Action |
|-------------|----------|--------|
| < 35% | Frustration | Provide scaffolding |
| 35-70% | Optimal | Maintain difficulty |
| > 70% | Comfort | Increase difficulty |

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Frustration detected after 3-4 consecutive "again"
- ✅ Scaffolding provided (hint/worked example)
- ✅ Comfort detected after 4-5 consecutive "easy"
- ✅ Difficulty adjustment recommended

**Common Issues:**
- Zone not detected → Check Inference service running
- Wrong thresholds → Adjust in Orchestrator `assess_zpd_state()`

---

### 6. Gamification Tests

**Test:** `test_xp_calculation`

Verifies XP formula: `base_xp * rating_multiplier`

**Expected XP (difficulty = 5.0):**
| Rating | Base XP | Multiplier | XP Earned |
|--------|---------|------------|-----------|
| Again | 10 | 0.5 | 5 |
| Hard | 10 | 0.75 | 8 |
| Good | 10 | 1.0 | 10 |
| Easy | 10 | 1.25 | 13 |

**Common Issues:**
- XP not ordered correctly → Check `calculate_xp()` function
- XP too high/low → Verify difficulty values in database

---

### 7. Database Persistence Tests

**Test:** `test_session_data_persists`

Verifies reviews stored in database.

**Expected Database Records:**
- `ScheduledItem` - Updated with `nextReview`, `lastReview`
- `LearnerProfile` - `totalXP`, `fsrsStability`, `fsrsDifficulty` updated
- `CompetencyState` - Concept mastery tracking
- `Evidence` - Behavioral data (mouse, dwell time)

**Verification Queries:**
```sql
-- Check scheduled items
SELECT * FROM "ScheduledItem"
WHERE "learnerProfileId" = '<profile_id>'
ORDER BY "lastReview" DESC;

-- Check XP updated
SELECT "totalXP", level FROM "LearnerProfile"
WHERE "userId" = '<user_id>';

-- Check evidence records
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "Evidence"
WHERE "learnerId" = '<profile_id>'
  AND "createdAt" > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';
```

---

### 8. Error Handling Tests

**Tests:**
- `test_invalid_session_id` - Invalid session
- `test_invalid_rating` - Invalid rating value

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Return 400/404/422 (not 500)
- ✅ Error message in response
- ✅ No server crash

---

### 9. Performance Tests

**Tests:**
- `test_session_start_performance` - < 1000ms
- `test_answer_processing_performance` - < 500ms

**Performance Targets:**
| Operation | Target | Critical Threshold |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Session start | < 500ms | < 1000ms |
| Card load | < 200ms | < 500ms |
| Answer processing | < 300ms | < 500ms |
| WebSocket latency | < 50ms | < 100ms |

**Optimization Tips:**
- Use database connection pooling
- Cache concept/card metadata
- Optimize FSRS calculations
- Use async/await for service calls

---

## Test Results Interpretation

### All Tests Pass ✅

```
======================== 20 passed in 15.23s ========================
```

**Meaning:**
- All services working correctly
- Database operations successful
- FSRS scheduling functional
- ZPD adaptation working
- Ready for demo/production

---

### Some Tests Skipped ⏭️

```
=================== 15 passed, 5 skipped in 12.45s ===================
```

**Meaning:**
- Some services unavailable (e.g., Scheduler, Inference)
- Missing demo data
- Tests work with graceful degradation

**Action:** Review skip reasons:
```bash
pytest tests/integration/ -v -rs
```

---

### Tests Failed ❌

```
=================== 5 passed, 3 failed in 10.12s ===================
```

**Meaning:**
- Critical bug or service failure
- Database connection issue
- Service integration problem

**Action:**
1. Review error messages
2. Check service logs: `tail -f logs/*.log`
3. Verify database state: `npx prisma studio`
4. Run single failing test: `pytest tests/integration/ -k test_name -v -s`

---

## Common Test Failures

### 1. Connection Refused

```
httpx.ConnectError: [Errno 111] Connection refused
```

**Cause:** Service not running

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check which services are down
./scripts/start-all-services.sh

# Or start specific service
cd services/orchestrator
python main.py
```

---

### 2. Database Connection Error

```
psycopg2.OperationalError: could not connect to server
```

**Cause:** PostgreSQL not running

**Fix:**
```bash
# Start database
docker-compose up -d postgres

# Verify connection
psql -U nerdlearn -h localhost -d nerdlearn
```

---

### 3. No Cards Available

```
pytest.skip: No cards available for testing
```

**Cause:** Database not seeded

**Fix:**
```bash
cd packages/db
npx tsx prisma/seed.ts
```

---

### 4. Timeout Error

```
httpx.TimeoutException: Request timed out
```

**Cause:** Service responding slowly or hung

**Fix:**
- Check service logs for errors
- Increase timeout in test config
- Restart service

---

### 5. Authentication Failed

```
AssertionError: Login failed: Unauthorized
```

**Cause:** User not in database or wrong credentials

**Fix:**
- Verify user seeded: Check Prisma Studio
- Check password hash algorithm matches
- Re-run seed script

---

## Writing New Tests

### Test Template

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_my_feature(
    http_client: httpx.AsyncClient,
    test_user: Dict,
    auth_headers: Dict
):
    """Test description"""

    # Arrange
    # ... setup test data ...

    # Act
    response = await http_client.post(
        f"{ORCHESTRATOR_URL}/my/endpoint",
        json={"data": "value"},
        headers=auth_headers
    )

    # Assert
    assert response.status_code == 200
    data = response.json()
    assert "expected_key" in data

    print(f"✅ Test passed: {data}")
```

### Best Practices

1. **Use fixtures** for common setup (test_user, auth_headers)
2. **Clean up** test data after tests
3. **Use descriptive names** (test_what_when_then)
4. **Add markers** for organization (@pytest.mark.slow)
5. **Print results** for debugging
6. **Handle errors gracefully** (check status codes)
7. **Test edge cases** (empty data, invalid inputs)
